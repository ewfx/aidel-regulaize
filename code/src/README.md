## üèÉ How to Run
1. If you already have an existing Redis and MongoDB instance, provide the config (hostname, port) in ".env" fie situated under code/src

2. If however you do not have existing instances of Redis and/mongodDB you can start your own locally using DOCKER containers. 

3. Ensure you have the DOCKER applicaition installed and running

4. Navigate to code/src and execute this command in the terminal:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d

6. To kill the docker instances you can run the below command in terminal:
   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```
